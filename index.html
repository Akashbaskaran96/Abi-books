        <h2>Atomic Habits</h2>
        <h3> James Clear</h3>
        <p>Atomic Habits is the most comprehensive and practical guide on how to create good habits, break bad ones, and get 1 percent better every day. I do not believe you will find a more actionable book on the subject of habits and improvement.
            If you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. The problem is your system.
            Bad habits repeat themselves not because you don’t want to change but because you have the wrong system for change. This is one of the core philosophies of Atomic Habits: You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. In this book, you’ll get a proven plan that can take you to new heights.</p>
